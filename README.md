# kannenGranularEngine

A Granular Synthesis audio plugin that allows users to manipulate live audio with time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and echo effects. This plugin offers real-time control over granular parameters such as grain size, density, pitch shift, feedback, and more.

## Features
- Granular Synthesis Engine: Real-time time-stretching and pitch-shifting of audio.
- Grain Density and Size Control: Adjust how many grains are generated and their size for different textures.
- Pitch Shifting: Change the pitch of the grains for creative manipulation.
- Feedback Control: Adjust the amount of echo created by feedback in the delay line.
- Smooth Grain Envelope: Apply a smooth fade in/out for each grain to avoid abrupt sounds.
